# Repo: conferences
in that repository, I try to collect all the artefacts from my talks

The structure is simple:
at ``conferences``,   
namely ``<NAME>``  
I am either ``talk``ing or doing ``workshop``s, or ``other`` stuff.   

Got it? :-)   
conferences > NAME > (talk | workshop | other) > FILE

### Note: 
I have a lot more talks last years, than this repo shows, but I try to enrich with the older talks successivly. Hope, I am able to maintain this, staying up to date
